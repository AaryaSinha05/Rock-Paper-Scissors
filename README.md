# ROCK---PAPPER---SCISSORS

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game played to settle disputes between two people. The game is played with three possible hand signals that represent a rock, paper, and scissors. The rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing downward; and scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing player.
